Their only hope lies with the nearby Mozi tribe, known far andwide for their particular skill at repelling sieges. As the flame of hope flickers at the edge of extinction, weaker hearts plead with the king of Liang to surrender, to throw the city's population to the mercy of the Zhao leaders, for the Mozi will not send their warriors to help. But help from the Mozi has arrived at the city gates -- a single man, unarmoured and humbly garbed.\n\n~~ Based on the Japanese historical novel \"Bokko\"; lit. \"Mohist Attack\" by Kenichi Sakemi, as well as the manga series Bokko by Hideki Mori.",

The Ming finds out and quickly dispatches assassins to attack the research lab, but Choi Hae San, the man in charge of the project, destroys himself along with the research materials to protect the weapon's secret.His daughter Hong Li barely escapes but loses the Chongtong Records (Singijeon's blueprints) to the Ming assassins.\n\nAs the Ming's diplomatic pressure increases on Joseon for making the Singijeon, Se Jong commands Chang Gang, the chief royal guard warrior, to take the only person with the potential to complete the Singijeon, Hong Li, safely to Sul Ju, a peddler. The son of the top engineer of Hwatong Dogam (place for making gunpowder and firearms-or a weapons factory in today's language) at the end of Goryeo dynasty, Sul Ju is an exceedingly intelligent man with the top martial art skills in Joseon. He rejects Joseon as a descendant of Goryeo migrants and lives as the head of a merchant gang. He refuses Chang Gang's command to help construct the Singijeon, but in order to save his gang from a fight with rivals, he is forced to join Hong Li in seeing the Singijeon completed.\n\nDesperate to understand the facts of Singijeon, the Ming sends an army disguised as a large envoy to intimidate Se Jong and the court. Meanwhile, the Ming army sets out to find Sul Ju's headquarters and completely destroy the slightest possibilities of developing Singijeon. After repeated failures in the project, Sul Ju risks his life to recover the Chongtong Records for Hong Li. However, he starts to have second thoughts as his comrades are sacrificed in battles.

But the journey to the top of South Korea’s fashion tree is not an easy one, and he is struggling to find the right path. One day, on the street, he bumps into Yeong Woo, an ever-optimistic part-time delivery worker. Even though it seems everyone he knows has formulated a grand plan abouthow their future will unfold, Yeong Woo doesn’t have a dream. While all others are in a rush to get somewhere in life, it seems that his own life is stuck in first gear.\n\nAlthough things have got off to a decidedly shaky start for Ki Jin and Yeong Woo, they start to develop a fondness for one another and start to wonder if their seemingly opposing blend of determinedness and acceptance could be a case of “opposites attract.” But when a leading model named Lee Bin arrives on the scene, things get complicated. He starts to develop a crush on Ki Jin. Could this development spell the end for the fledgling romance between Ki Jin and Yeong Woo?\n\n(Source: Viki)",

    "synopsis": "In 1970s Korea, when both art and dreams are censored, a film director dreams of a masterpiece. \n\nAfter his successful debut, Director Kim endures scathing attacks from critics who call him a specialist in trashy dramas. After finishing his latest feature ‘Cobweb’, he has vivid dreams over several days of an alternative ending to the film. Sensing that if he can just shoot those scenes as he envisioned them, a masterpiece willsurely emerge, he tries to arrange just two days of additional shooting. However, the rewritten script fails to pass censorship, and his actors can’t make sense of the new ending. Between the tangled schedule, the opposition of the producer, and the collision between these fantastic scenes dancing before his eyes and the harsh conditions of reality, Director Kim feels he is about to go insane, but he pushes on regardless…\n\n“If I can just change the ending, a masterpiece will emerge. All I need is two days!”\n\n(Source: Festival de Cannes international press kit)\n\n~~ Release dates: May 25, 2023 (Festival) || Sep 27, 2023 (Cinema)",

Soyo and Osawa exchange their first kiss through a small incident and naturally become a couple. Adults have their problems but for children, the festival in summer, hairstyles, and the ghost tale about a woman who died on the beach are far more important. There is no glamour but the time of purity passes never to be forgotten. After his previous film The Matsugane Potshot Affair, Nobuhiro Yamashita comes back with a peaceful and warm film. Based on the comics by Kuramochi Husako, the film captures the pure sentiment of children and their maturity that cannot be seen in the city. Beautifully shot summer days deliver its heat to viewers while the director induces sympathy naturally. The film is a must see for audiences who are nostalgic of innocent love and crisp shiny summer days. (KWON Young-min)",
